# GRIDExtracts
'GRIDExport.py' is a script which pulls data from GRID, puts it in the correct schema, creates a measured feature class, and puts the feature class on a local gdb.  The functionality to push the feature class to Comanche is written in the script, but commented out for now.
  
The end-goal is to put the finished script on the computer in Chris's office and set up task scheduler so that the script runs once a day and on specific days extracts certain assets.  See the excel spreadsheet for the schedule.  The schedule is subject to change.
